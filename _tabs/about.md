# About A{I}gile Deve{S}lopment

Welcome to my corner of the internet where **AI meets software development**!

## Who am I?

I'm **Mathias Kosinski** (derKosi), a .NET developer who has discovered the incredible potential of orchestrating AI agents to build real-world applications. Instead of just talking about AI, I'm actually using it to ship production software.

## What you'll find here

This blog documents my journey of building software with **AI-first development teams** where:

- **Kimi K2** handles architecture and cost analysis
- **GitHub Copilot** manages product ownership and backlogs  
- **Gemini CLI** does the heavy lifting on backend, frontend, and DevOps
- **Various AI models** handle security, testing, and legacy integration

## Recent Adventures

I've successfully built a **multi-tenant document storage system** in just 10 days using an all-AI crew - complete with:
- .NET 9 Aspire orchestration
- Angular 18 frontend + WinForms legacy clients
- Azure deployment with Bicep IaC
- Full CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## Why "A{I}gile"?

It's a play on "Agile" development, but with AI at the core. I believe we're entering a new era where AI agents can handle most development tasks, allowing humans to focus on strategy, creativity, and problem-solving.
